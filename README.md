# Extra-Problems
Some extra problems based on DSA.

<ins>KSum</ins>: We are given an array, a number n and k, we need to find all the unique combinations of k numbers that sum up to n. If n=10 and k=4, we need to find all unique 
set of numbers of size 4 from the array that sum up to 10. The ksum function takes in a sorted array.

<ins>Spiral Matrix</ins>: Displaying a matrix in spiral form. This means the outer most elements are displayed first and then the innermost in a circular/spiral manner. 
     
     matrix = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]], 
              
    result = 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5.
